# Contributing

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
3. Make sure your code lints.
4. Issue that pull request!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

- You can try running `npm run lint` for style unification

## Coding guidelines

1. Write readable code. Readable code is easier to understand, which makes it easy to debug, maintain and extend.

2. File names – file name should be in small letter and describe the feature.

3. Variables/Function names – Names should be meaningful and descriptive so that next developer can understand them

4. Write small and pure functions – small functions are easy to understand, test and maintain.

5. Remove unused code – You should make sure there in no unused code is being pushed, it could be almost impossible to certain whether piece of code being used or not in future if you let unused code stay.

6. Write code that explain itself instead of wasting time in comments.

7. Single responsible principle – function should be responsible for single task.

8. Make sure there is no tslint error and your code is formatted using prettier formatter for consistency.

9. All the stylesheet should be inside `xotb-theme` project and use `scss` file for stylesheet.
