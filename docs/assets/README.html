<p>
  xOTB - EDGE&#39;s design system. Designed for Designers and Developed for
  Engineers.
</p>
<h2 id="objective">Objective</h2>
<p>
  xOTB establishes a common design language for our teams, hosts design assets
  and patterns for a unified experience, provides basic building blocks to
  accelerate development, and drafts high level guidelines for content and
  accessibility.
</p>
<h2 id="the-clarity">The Clarity</h2>
<p>
  The Clarity consists of predefined variables for basic design elements such as
  colour, typography, and iconography. With clearly authenticated guidelines and
  governance for design and content creation, we spend less time talking the
  guidelines to bring clarity for ourselves and more time creating designs and
  content that clearly serves our users.
</p>
<h2 id="the-components">The Components</h2>
<p>
  The Components provides a robust suite of Angular components out of the box to
  bootstrap experiences and ensure consistent interaction and style as well as
  accessibility optimizations. With components, we spend more time on crafting
  experiences that serve our users and less time on “reinventing the wheel”.
