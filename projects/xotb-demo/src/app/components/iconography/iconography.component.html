  <p>
    We use symbols and icons to re-authorize our content. Iconography keeps up
    context between views, gives clearness and direction to actions, and
    decreases the cognitive burden for users.

    xOTB V2 leverages the very popular icon framework Feather Icons. Each icon
    is designed on a 24x24 grid with an emphasis on simplicity, consistency and
    usability. With over 200 beautiful and easy to use SVG icons, you are a few
    stones away to craft clear and communicative UI.
